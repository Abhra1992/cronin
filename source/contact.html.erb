    <h4>Get in Touch for a Project or Coffee</h4>
    <p>
      So you want to contact me, right? Well, let's see. If you want to say hello, ask a question or
      share your thoughts, and succeed in the task of filling out the form to the right then you might just
      be able to do exactly that. I'll receive your message, read it, tear it up and throw it dramatically
      into the fire. Oh, and then I'll respond, of course. If you don't think you can handle it, you
      could always just pop in an <u><%= link_to 'email', 'mailto:abhra.1992@live.com', :class => 'email' %></u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are writing because you think I would be a good fit for your project, please include as
      much relevant detail as possible, how you see I may best be of help, and the like. For everything
      else, type away, my friends. Type away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a contact form person? Use the icons below to track me around the world. It's not too hard to find me.
