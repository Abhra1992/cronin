  <h4>Get in Touch</h4>
  <p>
    So you want to contact me, right? Well, let's see. If you want to say hello, ask a question or 
    share your thoughts, and succeed in the task of filling out the form below then you might just 
    be able to do exactly that. I'll receive your message, read it, tear it up and throw it dramatically 
    into the fire. Oh, and then I'll respond, of course. If you don't think you can handle it, you 
    could always just pop in an email. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are writing because you think I would be a good fit for your project, please include as 
    much relevant detail as possible, how you see I may best be of help, and the like. For everything 
    else, type away, my friends. Type away.
