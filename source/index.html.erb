    <h4>Hey, Hi and Hello!</h4>
    <p>
      My name is ABHRA BASAK. I am a 21-year old Computer Science Undergraduate
      in <b><%= link_to 'IIT Mandi', 'http://iitmandi.ac.in' %></b> (living in Kolkata).
      I am passionate about Web Technologies, and also enjoy Programming, Football, Mathematics, Action Movies and Pop Music.
      This is my cool website made with style.

      I'm always looking for ideas that might make my work more creative. I'm especially interested in Computer
      Technologies and the Web. That's why I've decided to get deeply involved in
      Web Development, which is my main focus today, and that it will be hopefully in the long term.
