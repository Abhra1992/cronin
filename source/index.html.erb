      <strong>Hey, Hi and Hello!</strong> I am a 21-year old Computer Science Undergraduate
      in <strong><%= link_to 'IIT Mandi', 'http://iitmandi.ac.in' %></strong> (living in Kolkata).
      I am passionate about Web Technologies, and also enjoy Programming, Football, Puzzles, Action Movies and Pop Music.
      I'm glad you visited my website. Have a look around.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always looking for ideas that might make my work more creative. In my free time, I read developers' blogs and
      build sotware that is easy to use. I derive inspiration from popular music, and love listening to Internet Radio.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have recently undertaken an internship with <strong><%= link_to 'Microsoft', 'http://microsoft.com' %></strong> IDC (Hyderabad),
      in <strong><%= link_to 'Bing', 'http://bing.com' %></strong> Tech-Segments, who have gladly extended a full-time offer to me.
      I am currently involved in building an open-source framework,
      <strong><%= link_to 'HazelWard', 'https://github.com/Abhra1992/hazelward' %></strong> for NVIDIA CUDA,
      and am looking for contributors for the same.
